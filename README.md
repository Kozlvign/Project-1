# Project-1
My first project uploaded to github. As just a practice to improve my skills, I took this project and changed some parts of it for the sake of fun and knowladge of parts that I still don't know very well in this field.

I'm a freelancer, so I'm constantly making sites and using everything I know to fulfill customer's needs, but, only now, i decided to start exposing almost every improvement, in my career as a front-end web developer, in github.
